HTMLRegister
============

This is a test project.  I wanted to create a plugin for minecraft that you could tie into an html form mailer.
It would allow someone to register to a server through a website.  This way people can read rules first, see what
plugins are installed and be able to see what they can do.  That way they know firsthand before joining the
server, what they will be able to accomplish.
